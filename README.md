# lammps-aluminum-optimization
LAMMPS model to optimize aluminum structure size
This repository contains scripts and documentation for running molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of aluminum using LAMMPS.
The simulations investigate the mechanical and thermodynamic properties of single-crystal Al under uniaxial tensile deformation and thermal equilibration.

Execution environment:

CPU-based simulation (GPU required)

Runs on standard HPC cluster or local workstation

SLURM script: 

**2.0 Software Environment Setup**

This input script was run using the Aug 2015 version of LAMMPS. Changes in some commands may require revision of the input script. To get the input file, you have a few options:
